Design
========================

# Main style
An RPG style game taking inspiration from Terraria and Minecraft.

# Story

## Player
You play as a character (possibly scientist) that has survived through a post apoctolyptic war, by makeshifting a rocketship to blast of to a superplanet that is better than your current planet, making use of experimental technology that would freeze your age and body in time (not physical freeze, electronically / computer enduced) in order to make the trip.

You're goal is to survive, thrive, battle, loot, and possibly make it back to your home world to see the destruction that has ensued, bringing back survivors to your paradise homeworld.

The player has brought an Advanced Materials Unit (A.M.U. for short) from their home world, it was
damaged in the first explosion that caused them to leave and will need repairs in order to be usable. Once repaired, this Work Unit (W.U. maybe a name for all â€œUnits" used to aid the player in making stuff) this W.U. can be used as a starting point to make almost all advanced technologies that can be used to aid the player in survival and habitiation of this planet. This tool however has a cost to unlock
blueprints, which might consist of a rare mineral.

The player also has a Computer Aided Guidance System (C.A.G.S.) which is used to "guide" the player throughout their journy. This little robot, that flies around the player all the time, was awoken from it's deep sleep mode when it detected excessive loud noise and a bunch of crash detections. Following it's initial programming, it scanned the aread for signs of life and life forms in need, and found the player and healed them to an okay health.

## Civilizations

### Ancient
In this unknown and mysterious world there are ancient alien relics from a distant and almost forgotted past. Some of the relics recovered can contain very useful infomation about places and discoveries, lore, and myths about this place.

### Current
A civilization related to the distant past, the player might find around. They are not the most advanced civilization, however they do possess abilities to survive and also thrive.
